Urgent:

Load shape file of destinations

Navigation to destination (might work but test)

Manage destinations (random and charging station when battery low). Service? With parameter specifying type of destination. We might need to interrupt normal navigation when battery low.

Launch file for navigation. Also look at order of starting and restart if failure 

Reintroduce map clearing as a recovery strategy in the behaviour tree

Build new robot

Order oak pro cameras (can we move money from time to hardware?)



Less urgent:

Shutdown pi while charging

Look for birds?
